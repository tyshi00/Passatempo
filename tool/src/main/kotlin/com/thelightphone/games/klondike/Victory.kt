/**
 * The payoff: cards launch off the foundations one at a time, bounce along the
 * bottom of the screen and slide out the sides.
 *
 * Plain numbers and no drawing code, so the whole thing can be stepped and
 * checked in a unit test. An animation that never finishes would leave the win
 * screen unreachable, so "it always ends" is a property worth asserting rather
 * than hoping for.
 *
 * Everything is in dp and seconds.
