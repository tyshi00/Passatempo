/**
 * Answers "can this still be won?" honestly.

 * Depth first search over every legal action with a table of positions already
 * seen. Three outcomes, and the difference between the last two matters:
 *
 *  - [Verdict.WINNABLE]   a win was found, so one exists.
 *  - [Verdict.UNWINNABLE] the search ran out of positions to try before it ran
 *                         out of budget. Every position reachable from here has
 *                         been visited and none of them wins. That is a proof,
 *                         not a guess.
 *  - [Verdict.UNKNOWN]    the budget ran out first. Says nothing either way.
 *
 * Klondike solvability is hard in general, so [Verdict.UNKNOWN] is the common
 * answer from a fresh deal. Positions that are actually lost tend to have a
 * small reachable space, which is exactly when the proof lands.
